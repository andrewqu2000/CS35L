1.
I plugged in the board via USB to my computer.

2.
Opened the BEAGLEBONE as an external storage device.
Opened the START file.

3.
Nothing seems to work.
I downloaded the driver from the website, but failed to install it.
I looked up online for this problem and took the following step:
Restart the computer while pressing shift
Click on "Troubleshoot"
Select "Startup Settings"
Press "Restart"
Press F7 

4.
Opened the BEAGLEBONE as an external storage device.
Opened the START file.
Download the driver again.
Install the driver, and make sure to continue for every warning.

5.
Open http://192.168.7.2 as instructed in the START page.

6.
Go back to the setup guide on Piazza.
Open PuTTY.
Enter "192.168.7.2" as the hostname.
Press "Open".
Click "Yes" for the warning.
Enter "root" as username.
Password is not asked.

7.
The following lines are commands I entered in PuTTY to connect
to UCLA_WEB:
connmanctl
enable wifi
scan wifi
services
agent on
connect wifi_2cf7f106a1e9_55434c415f574542_managed_none
quit

After I entered my password, a message is shown that the wifi is
connected.

8.
Next, I try to find my IP address as I enter "ifconfig".
I find "inet addr:172.28.146.48" under "wlan0".

9.
Update the the database of apt-get with command:
sudo apt-get update
Install xauth and xvfb for X11 forwarding support with commands:
sudo apt-get install xauth
sudo apt-get install xvfb

10.
I entered /etc/ssh/ssh_config with:
nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config
I change "ForwardAgent no" to "ForwardAgent yes" and "ForwardX11 no"
to "ForwardX11 yes".
I press C-x, y, and Enter.

I entered /etc/ssh/sshd_config with:
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
It contains "X11Forwarding yes".
I press C-x to exit.

11.
I installed Firefox with:
sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb

12.
I logged out PuTTY and logged in again with "Enable X11 forwarding"
checked.

13.
I check if OpenSSH is installed:
dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
I see:
openssh-client                                  install
openssh-server                                  install
openssh-sftp-server                             install
Both openssh-client and openssh-server are installed.

14.
I am being the server now.
Generate public and private keys:
ssh-keygen
I press enter when asked for a path.
I enter "andrew" when asked to enter a passphrase and confirm.

15.
I create an account for the client, and I name it diwu:
sudo useradd -d /home/diwu -m diwu
sudo passwd diwu
I enter "wudi" when asked to enter new UNIX password and confirm.

16.
Create .ssh directory for the new user:
cd /home/diwu
sudo mkdir .ssh

17.
Change ownership and permission on .ssh:
sudo chown -R diwu .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

18.
I connect the board onto my own hotspot:
connmanctl
scan wifi
services
agent on
connect wifi_2cf7f106a1e9_42696c6c205775_managed_psk
<my password>
quit

After I entered my password, a message is shown that the wifi is
connected.

19.
I check my IP address again:
ifconfig
It is now: 192.168.43.227
I give it to my partner this address along with his username and
password.

20.
Now, I am being the client.
I am given my username and my partner's IP address, so I copy my
public key accordingly:
ssh-copy-id -i user1@192.168.43.102
I enter "yes" when prompted.
I enter my password given.
I tried to ssh-add, but I was told "Could not open a connection
to your authentication agent."
I looked up online and follow this procedure:
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add
<my passphrase>

21.
I then log in to my account:
ssh user1@192.168.43.102
I was not prompted to enter password because of ssh-agent.
I played around with command "ls" and then exit.

22.
I opened Xming on my computer.
Now I log in with X11:
ssh -X user1@192.168.43.102
I enter:
firefox
There are a number of errors like this one:
(firefox-esr:3064): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_object_ref: assertion 'object->ref_count > 0' failed
But Firefox still opens normally, so I just leave them there.
Some pages are shown, and I try to open google.com. It is just
too slow to respond, so I give up. I press C-c to terminate it.

I then enter:
xeyes
I then see a pair of eyes which will follow my cursor.

23.
Now I install xeyes for my partner to run on my board.
sudo apt-get install xeyes
I got an error "E: Package 'xeyes' has no installation candidate".
I am prompted to install "x11-apps", so I do:
sudo apt-get install x11-apps
Now I enter:
xeyes
I see those eyes again. This app is ready for my partner to use.
