1.
The disk space used to represent the working files in this directory
is 159MB. The following command is used to check disk usage:
du -h ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L
The last entry is the whole directory, which is 509MB. A subtraction
with the .git folder is 159MB.

Using the same command, we find the entry:
350M    /u/cs/fac/eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L/.git
This is the Git repository. 350MB is used to represent it.

From the above command, we find a pariticularly large directory:
/u/cs/fac/eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L/.git/objects/pack
Then we inspect all files, including regular files, using the following
command:
du -h -a /u/cs/fac/eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L/.git/
We notice the following regular files (type confirmed with ls the
directory that they are in) to be particularly large:
24M     /u/cs/fac/eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L/.git/objects/pack/pack-24e56b1749b9320c560213d9045fa6cee42b4174.idx
311M    /u/cs/fac/eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L/.git/objects/pack/pack-24e56b1749b9320c560213d9045fa6cee42b4174.pack
The .pack file is a packfile, and the .idx file is an index. They
are large because the packfile contains the contents of all the objects
that were removed from your filesystem and the index contains offsets
into that packfile. They effectively merge multiple objects, so they
contain information of them.

2.
We cd to the git repo with:
cd /u/cs/fac/eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L/.git

Then, we find there are 176 branches local to the repository with:
git branch | wc -l

The idea is to first list all the branches and then count them.

There are 177 remote branches, similarly found by:
git branch -r | wc -l

3.
Using the following command, we get a list of 1 entry of remote
repositories:
git remote
The output is "origin". There is only one remote repository.

Using the following command, we try to find more information of the
remote repositories:
git remote -v
The output is:
origin  https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git (fetch)
origin  https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git (push)
The remote repository origin is at
https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git.

4.
The ten local branches most recently committed to are:
  master
  scratch/joaot/make-completion-at-point-function
  feature/windows-with-utils
  scratch/completion-api
  scratch/a-modest-completion-redesign-proposal
  scratch/fido-mode
  feature/gnus-select2
  feature/extend_face_id
  scratch/jit-lock-antiblink-cleaned-up
  emacs-26

They are the first ten entries of the output from the following
command:
git branch --sort=-committerdate

The command sorts all branches in the descending order of date
of commit.

5.
We use the following command to count the number of commits in the
master branch:
git rev-list --count master
The output is:
139583
Thus, there are 139583 commits in the master branch.

6.
We first use the following command to count the number of commits
in any branch:
git rev-list --all --count
The output is:
143910
Thus, the previous output divided by this output gives the percentage
of the commits that are in any branch, are also in the master branch:
96.99%.

7.
We use the following command to count the number of commits by each
author since December 31, 2012 so that the range should starts in
2013:
git shortlog -n -s --since="2012-12-31"

The output is in a descending order. The first ten entries, which are
the ten people who authored the most master-branch commits that were
committed in the year 2013 or later, are:
  3691  Eli Zaretskii
  3647  Glenn Morris
  3605  Paul Eggert
  1806  Lars Ingebrigtsen
  1784  Stefan Monnier
  1571  Michael Albinus
   619  Dmitry Gutov
   576  Noam Postavsky
   471  Alan Mackenzie
   469  Juri Linkov
The number on the left of each name is the number of commits each of
them authored during that period.

I logged in again using PuTTY with X11 enabled.
I first cd to ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L.
Then I enter "gitk".
The window of gitk pops up.
I copy each ID to the blank for SHA1 ID and then hit "Go to:". Then,
I visually inspect them.
Here is their relationship:

First, we have commit 4ea37c2b8b0c5a68fde59770c3536195e0972217 in
the repository. After this commit, two branches are formed. The
first commit in each branch are respectively
977cd6cb28a37744966ec62f70cf62659f6f302a and
625cee531623feddbe3174fad52c7db96ec60bb3. Both branches continue
to be modified. At 5490ccc5ebf39759dfd084bbd31f464701a3e775, one
of the branches further branches into two. However, at
0c06b93c1e467debd401eb0b3be4652fde14fa95, one of the sub-branches
is merged onto the other original branch, but it still continues
to develop to 820739bbb572b30b6ce45756c9960e48dca859af, where it
branches again. One of the sub-branches branches for another time
at 00e4e3e9d273a193620c3a4bb4914e555cb8e343. All branches continue.
The last-mentioned sub-branch merge back to the the branch created
at the very beginning after 49cd561dc62ea6b3fbedab7aef0f020733f4cf09,
while it also continues to develop at the same time. The merge
happens at abcb2e62dae6aa26308f7ac9efc89247f89cbe65. The two branches
merge again in the exactly same manner at
98ac36efe4ce4bd3a0bca76fc73ce6c7abaa4371.

My hypothesis is that each branch happens when two prbolems started
to be solved independently, while each merge happens when one of the
problems is partially solved so that it could be integrated back.
