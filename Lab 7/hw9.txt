git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils d1
// I cloned Diffutils into a new repo to make sure everything
   is unmodified.
cd d1
// Change to the new directory.
git checkout v3.0 -b quote
// Checkout version 3.0 to a new branch called quote.

3.
patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt
// Patch the current branch with my patch created previously.

I read through the link provided in the spec.

I check the files that have been modified using the output from
question 3:
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c
I open each of them and press C-x 4 a. Then I add "Change ` in
string constants to '" after the file name.
The entries I added look like this:
2019-11-17  Jingnong Qu  <classjqu@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

        * src/util.c: Change ` in string constants to '.

        * src/sdiff.c: Change ` in string constants to '.

        * src/dir.c: Change ` in string constants to '.

        * src/diff3.c: Change ` in string constants to '.

        * src/diff.c: Change ` in string constants to '.

        * src/cmp.c: Change ` in string constants to '.

git add .
// Add file contents to the index.
git commit -F src/ChangeLog
// Commit the changes with the message being the file ChangLog.
   (The file ChangeLog is empty originally, so it is everything
   added)

git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt
// Create a patch for the most recent commit, which is the one
   I just made.

// My partner is Di Wu. I renamed his patch as diwu.txt because
   there has already been a formatted-patch.txt (mine) under pwd.
git checkout -b partner v3.0
// Check out version 3.0 again to a new branch partner.
git am < diwu.txt
// Apply my partner's patch.

make distdir
// After running this command, we see a new directory:

emacs diffutils-3.0.1-bddc/ChangeLog

git checkout quote

   ChangeLog entries work well.

I installed xming on my computer. Then I relogged into my
account on the server with X11 option on in my PuTTY.

export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
// I updated my path.
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
// Change directory to our destination.
gitk
// Run gitk in this directory. A window pop up on my desktop.
   I scroll down to around 2015-01-25. The newest merge not
   newer than 2015-01-25 was made at 17:11:31 on 2015-01-24.
   It was made by Joakim Verona. The merge merges a branch
   whose latest commit was "(find-function-regexp): Don't
   match `defgroup'" with the master branch. Meanwhile, the
   branch which is not master also continues. The window is
   gernally divided into 3 subwindows. The upper window is
   the information of changes of this git, with the tree,
   the information of the person who made the change. Below
   it is some bars for moving around each change. The lower
   part of the window has two subwindows. The left one is
   the content of the change, while the right one gives the
   name of the parts in the selected change.
