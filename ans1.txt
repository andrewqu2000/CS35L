   oldest regular file: librom1394.so.0.3.0
10. command used:
    man locale
    The command gets data based on the settings of the environment
variables that control the locale and from
/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive, as it is the usual default locale
archive location.
11. commands used:
    C-h
    ?
    a
    downcase
    C-x 1
    commands with "downcase":
    downcase-dwim
    downcase-region
    downcase-word
12. commands used:
    C-h
    ?
    k
    C-M-r (C-M-s, C-M-t, C-M-u, C-M-v)
    C-x 1
    actions:
    C-M-r: do incremental search backward for regular expression
    C-M-s: do incremental search forward for regular expression
    C-M-t: transpose sexps, like C-t, but for sexps
    C-M-u: move backward out of one level of parentheses
    C-M-v: scroll next window upward ARG lines; or near full
    screen if no ARG.
13. commands used:
    C-h
    ?
    K
    C-g
    C-x b
    ans1.txt
    action:
    'C-g' is quitting. It gets rid of a partially typed command, or
    a numeric argument that you don't want. Furthermore, if you
    are in the middle of command that is running, 'C-g' stops the
    command in a relatively safe way.
14. commands used:
    C-h
    ?
    f
    yank
    C-x 1
    function:
    Function 'yank' is bound to C-y.
    This function reinserts the most recent kill, which is the
    stretch of killed text most recently killed OR yanked.
15. Emacs commands used:
    C-h
    ?
    w
    dired
    C-x d
    /usr/bin
    Shell commands used:
    ls -l /usr/bin
    Difference:
    Using shell, a lot of items at the beginning (those before import)
    could not be displayed as they are above the top where I can
    scroll up, while emacs could display everything in one buffer. In
    addition, shell colors regular files with green, while they are
    just white in emacs.
